Hello! I'm Brandon Bondig, a 22-year-old second-year software university student at Aalborg University in Denmark. I have a deep love for software development, and I excel in web development. Additionally, I have a strong interest in embedded systems, where I enjoy exploring the interaction between software and hardware.

When I'm not coding or studying, I love to learn new technologies and work on personal projects that challenge and expand my skill set. My goal is to continue growing as a developer and contribute to exciting and innovative projects in the tech industry.

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat about technology!
