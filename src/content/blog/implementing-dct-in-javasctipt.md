description: Implement discrete cosine transform (DCT) in JavaScript to encode and decode hidden messages in images using steganography.
---

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret data. One common technique for steganography in images is to embed hidden messages by altering the pixel values in a way that is not easily detectable by the human eye, like using the least significant bit. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement steganography using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in JavaScript.
